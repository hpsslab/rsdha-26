--Summary-- 

Recent trends toward the end of Dennard scaling and Mooreâ€™s law makes 
the current and upcoming computing systems more specialized and complex, 
consisting of more complex and heterogeneous architectures in terms of 
processors, memory hierarchies, on-chip-interconnection networks, 
storage, etc. This trend materialized in the mobile and embedded market, 
and it is entering the enterprise, cloud computing, and high performance 
computing markets. 

RSDHA is a forum for researchers and engineers in both HPC domain and 
embedded/mobile computing domain to gather together and discuss (1) the 
latest ideas and lessons learned from the previous experience on 
traditional (i.e., horizontal) and heterogeneity-based (i.e., vertical) 
scaling in their own domains and (2) possible synergistic approach and 
interaction between the two domains to find a good balance between 
programmability and performance portability across diverse ranges of 
heterogeneous systems from mobile to HPC. 


--Scope and Goals-- 

The RSDHA workshop aims to serve as a forum for investigating the 
un-explored region of the two-dimensional space of traditional 
node-based (i.e., horizontal) and heterogeneity-based (i.e., vertical) 
scaling of the current and upcoming HPC and mobile/embedded systems. 

The scope of this workshop can be categorized in two primary areas: 
1) Vertical Scaling, which will cover the studies that will enable HPC 
applications to utilize a more diverse range of processors, and 
2) Horizontal Scaling, which will cover the studies that investigate the 
application of the traditional HPC techniques to the mobile and 
autonomous systems to beat the multi-node scalability challenges as the 
mobile/embedded systems become increasingly more connected. 


--Research Areas of Interest-- 

The research areas of interest include but are not limited to: 
- Performance-portable parallel programming paradigms for emerging 
accelerator types 
- Runtimes for arbitrary degrees of heterogeneous diversity 
- Analytical modeling for general-purpose and domain-specific 
programmable accelerators 
- Application of heterogeneous programming/scheduling techniques used 
in embedded and mobile computing to HPC systems and vice versa 
- Communication and memory access challenges for clustered execution 
of highly diverse platforms 
- Analytical resource consumption modeling and decision making 
mechanisms for edge-cloud and HPC systems 
- Compositional resource management and workload balancing across the
collaborative clusters 
- Fault tolerant and resilient execution for mobile/autonomous 
systems and HPC systems 
- Case studies using the vertical/horizontal scaling techniques
