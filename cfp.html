            <p>Recent  trends  toward  the  end  of  Dennard  scaling  and  Mooreâ€™s  law  makes  the  current  and  upcoming computing  systems  
                more  specialized  and  complex,  consisting  of  more  complex  and  heterogeneous  architectures  in  terms  of  processors,  
                memory  hierarchies,  on-chip-interconnection  networks,  storage,  etc.
            This  trend  materialized  in  the  mobile  and  embedded  market,  and  it  is  entering  the  enterprise, cloud computing, 
                and high performance computing markets. 
            RSDHA is a forum for researchers  and  engineers in  both HPC domain and embedded/mobile computing domain to gather together and 
                discuss 1) the latest ideas and lessons learned from the previous experience on traditional (i.e., horizontal) and heterogeneity-based 
                (i.e., vertical) scaling in their own domains and 2) possible synergistic approach and interaction between the two domains 
                to find a good balance between programmability and performance portability across diverse ranges of heterogeneous systems from mobile to HPC.</p>

            <p>The RSDHA workshop aims to serve as a forum for investigating the un-explored region of the two-dimensional space of traditional node-based 
                (i.e., horizontal) and heterogeneity-based (i.e., vertical) scaling of the current and upcoming HPC and mobile/embedded systems.
            The scope of this workshop can be categorized in two primary areas: 1) Vertical Scaling, which will cover the studies that will enable 
                HPC applications to utilize a more diverse range of processors, and 2) Horizontal Scaling, which will cover the studies that investigate 
                the application of the traditional HPC techniques to the mobile and autonomous systems to beat the multi-node scalability challenges 
                as the mobile/embedded systems become increasingly more connected.</p>

            <p>The topics of interest include but are not limited to:
            </p>

            <ul>

                <li> Performance-portable parallel programming paradigms for newly emerging accelerator types</li>

                <li> Runtimes for arbitrary degrees of heterogeneous diversity</li>

                <li> Analytical modeling for general-purpose and domain-specific programmable accelerators</li>

                <li> Application of heterogeneous programming/scheduling techniques used in embedded and mobile computing to HPC systems and vice versa</li>

                <li> Communication  and  memory  access  challenges  for  clustered  execution  of  highly  diverse  platforms</li>

                <li> Analytical  resource  consumption  modeling  and  decision  making  mechanisms  for  edge-cloud systems</li>
                
                <li> Compositional resource management and workload balancing across the collaborative clusters</li>

                <li> Fault tolerant and resilient execution for mobile and autonomous systems</li>

                <li> Case studies using the vertical/horizontal scaling techniques</li>

            </ul>
